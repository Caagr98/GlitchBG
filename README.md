###### A rather buggy-looking Android live wallpaper

I accidentally made this while trying to make my [Earthbound live wallpaper][EBBG], but it looked weird and cool enough to keep it.
I did clean it up a bit, though.

No animals were harmed during the making of this app, but my phone froze a dozen or so times.

## Known bugs

None (except the entire thing is a bug, of course)
